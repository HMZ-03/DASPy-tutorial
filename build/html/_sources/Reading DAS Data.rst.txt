Reading DAS Data
=============================================


Reading
------------------------------

The ``read function`` is used to read multiple types of DAS data files. It supports reading .h5, .tdms, .segy/.sgy files, and also supports reading instances of ``Section`` class saved as a .pkl file (see below).

By default, the function will output a Section class instance containing data and metadata. You can set ``output_type='array'`` to output data in ``numpy.array`` format, in which case metadata will be output in ``dict`` format. Setting ``ch1`` or/and ``ch2`` limits the range of channels to read.

Read the example waveform as a ``Section`` instance (recommended) or ``numpy.array`` and ``dict``:

    >>> from daspy import read
    >>> sec = read()
    >>> data, metadata = read(output_type='array', ch1=2700, ch2=2800) # set channel range


Section
------------------------------

The functions of DASPy can be implemented by calling functions (process-oriented) or through class methods (object-oriented). We recommend an object-oriented approach to operate on the ``Section`` class of the DAS data body. All user-facing functions and class methods in DASPy have the same name and are nouns (such as ``normalization`` and ``Section.normalization``).

The attributes of the ``Section`` class save the DAS data and header information, among which the waveform data ``data``, channel spacing ``dx``, and sampling rate ``fs`` must be set (but can be temporarily Set to ``None`` ); the starting channel number ``start_channel``, the starting distance ``start_distance``, and the starting time ``start_time`` default to 0 if not set; the event starting time ``origin_time``, gauge length ``gauge_length``, data type ``data_type``, data scale ``scale``, array geometry ``geometry``, turning point channel number ``turning_channels``, other header information ``headers`` are not necessary.

Accessing meta dataï¼š

    >>> print(sec)
                  data: shape(500, 5000)
                    dx: 1 m
                    fs: 100.0 Hz
         start_channel: 2500
        start_distance: 2520 m
            start_time: 2016-03-21 07:37:30.532309+00:00
           origin_time: 2016-03-21 07:37:10.535000+00:00
             data_type: strain rate

In addition, the data size ``shape``, the number of channels ``nch``, the number of sampling points ``nt``, the end channel number ``end_channel``, the end distance ``end_distance`` and the end time ``end_time`` will Automatically calculated and can be called as a property.


DASDateTime
------------------------------

DASPy create the ``DASDateTime`` class to represent the time information of the data, including the start time ``start_time``, the end time ``end_time`` and the event start time ``origin_time``.

``DASDateTime`` is a subclass of the ``datetime.DateTime`` class and inherits all methods of ``datetime.DateTime``:

    >>> from daspy.core import DASDateTime
    >>> DASDateTime.strptime('2021-03-19T1:52:23', '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S')
    DASDateTime(2021, 03, 19, 1, 52, 23)

DASPy has built-in local time zone ``local_tz`` and utc time zone ``utc`` for specifying the time zone:

    >>> from daspy.core.dasdatetime import utc, local_tz
    >>> DASDateTime.fromtimestamp(1616089943, tz=utc)
    DASDateTime(2021, 3, 18, 17, 52, 23, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc)

Use ``datetime.timezone(datetime.timedelta(hours=h))`` to create other time zones if needed.

In addition to the addition and subtraction operations between ``datetime.datetime`` and ``datetime.timedelta`` supported by the parent class itself, ``DASDateTime`` also supports input numbers and iterable objects ``Iterable`` to calculate additions and subtraction. All time differences are expressed in seconds (s), and problems with unspecified time zones are automatically handled:

    >>> DASDateTime(2021, 3, 24, 14, 28, 0, 0) + 100
    DASDateTime(2021, 3, 24, 14, 29, 40)
    >>> DASDateTime(2021, 3, 24, 14, 28, 0, 0) + [10, 20, 30]
    [DASDateTime(2021, 3, 24, 14, 28, 10), DASDateTime(2021, 3, 24, 14, 28, 20), DASDateTime(2021, 3, 24, 14, 28, 30)]
    >>> DASDateTime(2021, 3, 24, 14, 28, 0, 0) - 100
    DASDateTime(2021, 3, 24, 14, 26, 20)
    >>> DASDateTime(2021, 3, 24, 14, 28, 0, 0) - DASDateTime(2021, 3, 19, 1, 52, 23)
    477337.0

``DASDateTime`` instances can be converted to parent class ``datetime.datetime`` instances when necessary:

    >>> DASDateTime(2021, 3, 19, 1, 52, 23).convert_to_datetime()
    datetime.datetime(2021, 3, 19, 1, 52, 23)
